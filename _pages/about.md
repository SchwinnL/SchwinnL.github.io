I'm a Lecturer at the Technical University of Munich, interested in robust machine learning with a focus on data-efficient learning and robustness vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). 

Previously, I did my Ph.D. at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) under the supervision of Prof. Björn Eskofier, receiving the (ATE dissertation price)[https://www.tf.fau.de/2024/11/allgemein/verleihung-der-promotionspreise-2024/]. During my PhD I conducted an internship under the supervision of [Prof. Doina Precup at the Mila Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/person/leo-schwinn/). After my PhD, I worked as a Postdoc at FAU and as a machine learning engineer at Robert Bosch on robust computer vision for autonomous driving. 

### News

- January, 2025: We are presenting two papers at **ICLR 2025**! A [probabilistic perspective into unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03523), where we reveal that current evaluations are unreliabe. Moreover, we introduce a novel probabilistic time series forcasting algorithm [combining Gaussian Process priors and flow matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03024)

- September, 2024: Happy to have three papers accepted at **NeurIPS 2024**!, we [explore new threat models in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09063), propose the first [efficient adversarial training algorithm for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15589), and [explore scaling properties of Lipschitz-1 neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10388)
